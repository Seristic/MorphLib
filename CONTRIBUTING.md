# Contributing to MorphLib

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MorphLib! We welcome contributions from the community.

> **Note**: MorphLib is a **library mod** that provides data management for body proportions and morph states. It does not implement visual rendering or player model changes. Contributions should focus on the data layer, API improvements, and cross-platform compatibility.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Java 21** (required for Minecraft 1.21.4)
- **Git** for version control
- **Gradle** (included via wrapper)
- **Minecraft development environment** (optional, for testing)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MorphLib.git
   cd MorphLib
   ```

3. **Set up upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Seristic/MorphLib.git
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

6. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## Making Changes

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Java Conventions**: Follow standard Java naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Add JavaDoc for all public APIs
- **Logging**: Use the provided `ModLogger` for consistent logging
- **Error Handling**: Use appropriate exception handling and logging
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of changes

### Architecture Guidelines

- **Platform Agnostic**: Keep platform-specific code in respective modules
- **Data Layer Only**: MorphLib provides data management, not rendering
- **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing APIs without good reason
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure thread-safe operations where necessary
- **Clean API**: Keep public APIs simple and well-documented

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests for all modules:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Integration Tests

Test both platforms:

```bash
# Test NeoForge
./gradlew :neoforge:test

# Test Fabric
./gradlew :fabric:test
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Build the library**:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Run test environment**:

   ```bash
   # NeoForge
   ./gradlew :neoforge:runClient

   # Fabric
   ./gradlew :fabric:runClient
   ```

3. **Test with a dependent mod**:
   - Create a test mod that uses MorphLib API
   - Verify data storage and retrieval works correctly
   - Test client-server synchronization in multiplayer
   - Verify all MorphState fields are properly saved/loaded
