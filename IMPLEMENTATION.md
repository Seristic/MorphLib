# MorphLib - Complete Implementation Guide

## 📋 Summary

MorphLib is now fully implemented with the following features:

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Data Attachments System**

   - NeoForge attachments store `MorphData` on entities
   - Automatic attachment to Players and LivingEntities
   - Clean API via `MorphManager`

2. **Networking System**

   - `S2CMorphSyncPacket` - Syncs morph data to clients
   - `S2CMorphClearPacket` - Clears morph from entities
   - Automatic sync to all tracking players

3. **Rendering Integration**

   - `MorphRenderHandler` hooks into player rendering
   - Replaces player model with morph entity model
   - Copies position, rotation, and pose from player

4. **Command System**

   - `/morph <entity_id>` - Morph into any entity
   - `/unmorph` - Remove morph
   - Auto-complete for entity types
   - Requires OP level 2

5. **Logging Integration**
   - Uses `ModLogger` from HomesteadCore
   - Logs all operations (info, debug, error)

```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Build and Run

```powershell
./gradlew build
./gradlew :neoforge:runClient
```

### 2. In-Game Testing

1. **Start a world** (Creative mode recommended)
2. **Give yourself OP permissions**:

   ```
   /op YourUsername
   ```

3. **Test morphing into different entities**:

   ```
   /morph minecraft:cow
   /morph minecraft:zombie
   /morph minecraft:villager
   /morph minecraft:enderman
   /morph minecraft:creeper
   ```

4. **Test unmorphing**:

   ```
   /unmorph
   ```

5. **Test with modded entities** (if any):
   ```
   /morph modid:entity_name
   ```

### 3. Expected Behavior

- ✅ Your player model should be replaced with the entity model
- ✅ The morph should follow your movements
- ✅ Other players should see you morphed (multiplayer)
- ✅ Morph persists through respawn
- ✅ Morph clears when you use `/unmorph`

### 4. Check Logs

Look for these log messages in `logs/morphlib.log`:

```
[MorphLib] Logger Initialized Successfully
[MorphlibNeoForge] NeoForge mod initialized
[MorphManager] Morph accessor initialized
[MorphCommand] Morph commands registered
[MorphCommand] Player <name> morphed into minecraft:cow
[MorphRenderHandler] Successfully rendered morph for player: <name>
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Attachment System

```java
// Data is stored on entities using NeoForge attachments
entity.setData(MorphAttachments.MORPH_DATA, morphData);
MorphData data = entity.getData(MorphAttachments.MORPH_DATA);
```

### Command Flow

1. Player runs `/morph minecraft:cow`
2. Command creates `MorphData` with EntityType.COW
3. `MorphManager.applyMorph()` stores data on player
4. `MorphLibNetworking.sendToAllTracking()` syncs to clients
5. Clients receive packet and update their local morph data

### Rendering Flow

1. Client tries to render player
2. `MorphRenderHandler.onRenderPlayerPre()` is called
3. Checks if player has morph via `MorphManager.getMorph()`
4. Creates morph entity, copies player transform
5. Cancels player rendering, renders morph entity instead

### Networking Flow

```
Server: /morph command
  ↓
MorphManager.applyMorph()
  ↓
MorphLibNetworking.sendToAllTracking()
  ↓
S2CMorphSyncPacket sent to all clients
  ↓
Clients: Packet handler applies morph locally
  ↓
MorphRenderHandler renders morph entity
```

## 🎯 Key APIs

### Apply Morph

```java
MorphData data = new MorphData();
data.setEntityType(EntityType.COW);
MorphManager.applyMorph(player, data);
MorphLibNetworking.sendToAllTracking(player, data);
```

### Remove Morph

```java
MorphManager.removeMorph(player);
MorphLibNetworking.sendRemovalToAllTracking(player);
```

### Check Morph

```java
if (MorphManager.hasMorph(player)) {
    MorphData data = MorphManager.getMorph(player);
    EntityType<?> type = data.getEntityType();
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Morph doesn't render

- Check client logs for rendering errors
- Ensure entity type is valid
- Try a different entity type

### Commands don't work

- Verify you have OP permissions
- Check server logs for command registration
- Try `/help morph` to see if command exists

### Morph doesn't sync in multiplayer

- Check network packets are being sent (enable debug logging)
- Verify other players are tracking you
- Try re-logging

### Build errors

- Run `./gradlew clean build`
- Check JDK version (requires Java 21)
- Verify HomesteadCore dependency is accessible

## 📝 Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Size Scaling** - Scale player hitbox to match morph
2. **Ability System** - Grant entity abilities (fly as bat, breathe underwater as fish)
3. **Animation Sync** - Better sync player animations to morph
4. **GUI System** - In-game morph selection menu
5. **Permissions** - Per-entity permission system
6. **Fabric Support** - Implement Fabric morph accessor
7. **NBT Support** - Store custom NBT data on morphs
8. **Custom Skins** - Use MorphData.customSkin field

## ✨ Example Use Cases

1. **Roleplay Servers** - Players morph into NPCs
2. **Minigames** - Hide-and-seek with entity disguises
3. **Content Creation** - Machinima and screenshots
4. **Modpacks** - Integration with other mods

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Commands require OP level 2
- Morphing is server-authoritative
- Clients cannot force morphs
- All changes are validated server-side
